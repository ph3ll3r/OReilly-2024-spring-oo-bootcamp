We can think of a class as a factory for objects. So `str` is a class that creates new string objects. And `int` is a class that creates new integer objects. In fact, when you call `int('5')`, you are saying: I want to create a new integer based on the string `'5'`. When we invoke a class as a function, with `()`, we are creating a new object of that type.\n",
