We can think of a class as a factory for objects. So `str` is a class that creates new string objects. And `int` is a class that creates new integer objects. In fact, when you call `int('5')`, you are saying: I want to create a new integer based on the string `'5'`. When we invoke a class as a function, with `()`, we are creating a new object of that type.\n",

    "When we invoke a class to create a new instance, the *constructor method* for that class is invoked. As the name indicates, the constructor creates a new instance of our class, and gets it ready to be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many, many *MANY* people believe that the constructor in Python is `__init__`. They are completely wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real constructor method in Python is called `__new__`. You will never run it directly yourself. You will never implement it yourself. Let Python create the objects for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__new__` is invoked automatically when we call the class. It gets all of the arguments that you passed to the class.\n",
    "2. Inside of `__new__`, Python creates our new instance. The instance knows what type of object it is, but otherwise has no attributes.\n",
    "3. Where will those attributes be set? Inside of `__init__`. We need to somehow pass our object to `__init__`, along with all of the arguments that were passed to the class. We call `__init__` with the instance that was just created, as the first argument, along with all of the rest of the arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when we wrote\n",
    "\n",
    "    Company('BigCo', 'Money', 100000)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was behind the scenes, turned into\n",
    "\n",
    "    __init__(NEW_INSTANCE, 'BigCo', 'Money', 100000)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside of `__init__`, we can (and normally do) assign attributes to our new object. An attribute is basically a name that comes after a `.`, and is sort of a private dictionary on an object.\n",
    "5. The first parameter in `__init__` contains the new instance. In fact, in every method in Python, the first parameter contains the instance on which we're working. That parameter is called `self`, taken from the Smalltalk language. This is not a keyword, and is not set by Python. You could, in theory, use a different parameter name. **DON'T DO IT!**\n",
    "6. Because `self` refers to the instance, we can assign to `self`'s attributes. Those will stick around, even when `__init__` returns."

    "# Why do we even need `self`?\n",

    "One of the annoying things about objects in Python is `self`:\n",
    "- Every method's first parameter is `self`, meaning that the first argument will always be the instance on which we're running\n",
    "- When we want to retrieve attributes, we cannot just ask for `x`, but we must say `self.x`, to retrieve the attribute from the current instance\n",
    "- When we want to set attributes, we cannot just set `x`, but we must say `self.x`, to set the attribute on the current instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "This leads many people to wonder what the heck is wrong with Python! Why do we need to explicitly talk about `self` rather than just use variables, and the language will know that we're talking about attributes on our object.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In other languages, a class definition includes some declarations of what the instance variables aka fields aka attributes will be for an object. That allows the language to know in advance that when you set/retrieve `x`, are you talking about a variable? Or are you talking about an instance variable / field? In Python, we don't have such declarations, so there isn't any implicit way for the language to know.\n",
    "2. In Python, we have a very strict variable lookup rule called LEGB (local-enclosing-global-builtin). That has to do with all variables, inside and outside of methods/functions. In order for that rule to work, we need to use attributes stuck onto an object, and that object needs to be explicit. We use `self` to avoid confusing ourselves and Python between attributes and variables.\n",
