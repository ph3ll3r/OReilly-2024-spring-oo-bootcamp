    "The whole point of object-oriented programming is to create new types of data structures. These data structures contain within them the regular data structures that Python provides. So, what's the advantage?\n",
    "\n",
    "- By putting those core data structures (e.g., strings, lists, and dicts) inside of a class, we can think about and reason about our data at a higher level, and then use our class in other classes.\n",
    "- Methods are defined on the class, which means that they are tightly bound to a particular data type. This is as opposed to regular functions, which aren't connected to any particular type. You can call any function on any value, and it might or might not work. But if you try to call a method on a value for which it isn't defined, you'll get an error saying that it doesn't exist.\n",
    "- We will define classes, which are data types. A class is as type, and it's the factory that creates new objects. Each created object is called an \"instance.\"\n",
    "- The most important method in a class is `__init__`, whose job is to add attributes to a new instance.  If you create 5 new instances, then `__init__` runs five times, once per instance.\n",
    "- `__init__`, like all methods in Python, expects to get the instance on which we're running it as the first argument, assigned to the parameter `self`. (You don't have to use `self` as a name, but it's a very very strong convention.)\n",
    "- When we create/assign an attribute on `self`, we're adding to the private dictionary that the object has. This dict sticks around after `__init__`, and in general sticks around for the entire lifetime of the object.\n",
    "- Technically speaking, you don't need to define all attributes in `__init__`. At any time, in any place, you can add a new attribute to a Python object. However, it's a bad idea to do that; you should define your attributes all in `__init__` to make your code easier to understand.\n",
    "- To read from an attribute, just use `.NAME`, where `NAME` is the name of the attribute.\n",
    "- To set an attribute (i.e., to give it a new value), just assign to it.\n",
    "- To define a method, just define a function inside of the class body. The first parameter must be `self`, but all other parameters are standard for functions -- you can use defaults, `*args`, and `**kwargs` if you want."

If you assign an attribute to an object in Python, that attribute (basically, a private dictionary with a key-value store) sticks around for the lifetime of the object -- unless you remove or change it. When we assign to `self.name`, that means the object currently referred to by `self` (the current instance) will have a `name` attribute until the attribute is removed or the object goes away. It's crucial, then, to assign to `self.SOMETHING` and not just `SOMETHING`.\n",
